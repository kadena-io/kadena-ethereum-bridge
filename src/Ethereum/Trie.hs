-- Appendix D. Modified Merkle Patricia Tree
--
-- The modified Merkle Patricia tree (trie) provides a persistent data structure
-- to map between arbitrary-length binary data (byte arrays). It is defined in
-- terms of a mutable data structure to map between 256-bit binary fragments and
-- arbitrary-length binary data, typically implemented as a database. The core
-- of the trie, and its sole requirement in terms of the protocol specification,
-- is to provide a single value that identifies a given set of key-value pairs,
-- which may be either a 32-byte sequence or the empty byte sequence. It is left
-- as an implementation consideration to store and maintain the structure of the
-- trie in a manner that allows effective and efficient realisation of the
-- protocol.
